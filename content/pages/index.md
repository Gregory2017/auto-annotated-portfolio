    text: "Reading\_\n\nTask 1\n\nRead the text below. For assignments (1-5) choose the correct answer (A, B, C, D).\n\nEUTHANASIA\n\nThe word euthanasia is of Greek origin and literally means 'a good death.' The American Heritage Dictionary defines it as 'the act of killing a person painlessly for reasons of mercy.' Such killing can be done through active means, such as administering a lethal injection, or by passive means, such as withholding medical care or food and water.\n\nIn recent years in the United States, there have been numerous cases of active euthanasia in the news. They usually involve the deliberate killing of ill or incapacitated persons by relatives or friends who plead that they can no longer bear or see their loved ones suffer. Although such killings are a crime, the perpetrators are often dealt with leniently by the legal system, and the media portrays them as compassionate heroes who take personal risks to save another from unbearable suffering.\n\nThe seeming acceptance of active forms of euthanasia is alarming, but we face a bigger, more insidious threat from passive forms of euthanasia. Every year, in hospitals and nursing homes around the country, there are growing numbers of documented deaths caused by caregivers withholding life-sustaining care, including food and water, from vulnerable patients who cannot speak for themselves.\n\nWhile it is illegal to kill someone directly, for example with a gun or knife, in many cases the law has put its stamp of approval on causing death by omitting needed care. Further, many states have 'living will' laws designed to protect those who withhold treatment, and there have been numerous court rulings which have approved of patients being denied care and even starved and dehydrated to death.\n\nBecause such deaths occur quietly within the confines of hospitals and nursing homes, they can be kept hidden from the public. Most euthanasia victims are old or very ill, so their deaths might be attributed to a cause other than the denial of care that really killed them. Further, it is often relatives of the patient who request that care be withheld. In one court case, the court held that decisions to withhold life-sustaining care may be made not only by close family members but also by a number of third parties, and that such decisions need not be reviewed by the judicial system if there is no disagreement between decision makers and medical staff. The court went so far as to rule that a nursing home may not refuse to participate in the fatal withdrawal of food and water from an incompetent patient!\n\n'Extraordinary' or 'heroic' treatment need not be used when the chance for recovery is poor and medical intervention would serve only to prolong the dying process. But to deny customary and reasonable care or to deliberately starve or dehydrate someone because he or she is very old or very ill should not be permitted. Most of the cases coming before the courts do not involve withholding heroic measures from imminently dying people, but they seek approval for denying basic care, such as administration of food and water, to people who are not elderly or terminally ill, but who are permanently incapacitated. These people could be expected to live indefinitely, though in an impaired state, if they were given food and water and minimal treatment.\n\nNo one has the right to judge that another's life is not worth living. The basic right ot life should not be abridged because someone decides that someone else's quality of life is too low. If we base the right to life on quality of life standards, there is no logical place to draw the line.\n\nSo, we must foster more positive attitudes towards people with serious and incapacitating illnesses and conditions. Despite the ravages of their diseases, they are still our fellow with serious and incapacitating illnesses human beings and deserve our care and respect.\n\n1.\_\n\nThe term euthanasia means ...\n\nA new medicine from cancer.\n\nB an injection administration\n\nC an act of painless killing carried out for reasons\_ \_ \_ of mercy\n\nD a request that care be withheld\n\n2\\.\n\nIn many cases of euthanasia the US legal system.\n\nA is supportive and approving of euthanasia\n\nB disapproves the cases of euthanasia\_\n\nC considers the cases of euthanasia to be a crime\n\nD does not support euthanasia\n\n3.\_\n\nDeaths of euthanasia victims can be attributed to causes other than the denial of care because they are ...\_\n\nA of elderly age or very ill\n\nB permanently incapacitated\n\nC terminally ill\n\nD in an impaired state\n\n4.\_\n\nMost of the cases coming before the courts ...\n\nA involve withholding measures from dying people\n\nB seek approval for denying customary and reasonable care\n\nC protect people from those who consider their lives meaningless\n\nD judge that another's life is not worth living\n\n5\\.\n\nTo protect vulnerable patients we must . . .\n\nA deny basic care\n\nB foster more positive attitudes towards them\n\nC withhold treatment and life-sustaining care such as food and water\_\n\nD prolong the dying process\n\nTask 2\n\nRead the text below. Match choices (A-G) to (6-10). There are two choices you do not need to use.\n\nTHE MOST DIFFICULT LANGUAGE IN THE WORLD\n\n(6)\n\nPeople often ask which the most difficult language to learn is, and it is not easy to answer because there are many factors to take into consideration. Firstly, in a first language the differences are unimportant as people learn their mother tongue naturally, so the question of how hard a language is or learn is only relevant when learning a second language.\n\n(7)\n\nA native speaker of Spanish, for example, will find Portuguese much easier to learn than a native speaker of Chinese, because Portuguese is very similar to Spanish, while Chinese is very different, so the first language can affect learning the second language. The greater the differences between the second language and our first one, the harder it will be for most people to learn. Many people answer that Chinese is the hardest language to learn, possibly influenced by the thought of learning the Chinese writing system, and the pronunciation of Chinese does appear to be very difficult for many foreign learners. However, for Japanese speakers, who already use Chinese characters in their own language, learning writing will be less difficult than for speakers of languages using the Roman alphabet.\n\n(8)\n\nSome people seem to learn languages readily, while others find it very difficult. Teachers and the circumstances in which the language is learnt also play an important role, as well as each learner's motivation for learning. If people learn a language because they need to use it professionally, they often learn it faster than people studying a language that has no direct use in their everyday life.\n\n(9)\n\nApparently, British diplomats and other embassy staff have found that the second hardest language is Japanese, which will probably come as no surprise to many, but the language that they have found to be the most problematic is Hungarian, which has 35 cases of a noun. This does not mean that Hungarian is the hardest language to learn for everyone, but it causes British diplomatic personnel, who are generally used to learning languages, the most difficulty. In the case of Hungarian for British learners, it is not a question of the writing system, which uses a similar alphabet, but the grammatical complexity.\n\n(10)\n\nDifferent cultures and individuals from those cultures will find different languages more difficult. No language is easy to learn well, though languages which are related to our first language are easier. Learning a completely different writing system is a huge challenge, but that does not necessarily make a language more difficult than another one. In the end, it is impossible to say what language is the most difficult language in the world.\n\nA It is important to learn foreign languages\n\nB Hungarian causes a lot of difficulties in learning\n\nC People learn their mother tongue naturally\n\nD No language is easy to learn well\n\nE The first language can affect learning the second language\_\n\nF Learner's motivation for learning plays an important role\n\nG Portuguese is definitely easier than Chinese\n\n6\\.\n\n7\\.\n\n8\\.\n\n9\\.\n\n10\\.\n\nTask 3\n\nRead the text below. Choose the correct letter, A, B, C or D.\n\nPlastic is no longer fantastic\n\nA\n\nIn 2017, Carlos Ferrando, a Spanish engineer-turned-entrepreneur, saw a piece of art in a museum that profoundly affected him. 'What Lies Under', a photographic composition by Indonesian digital artist Ferdi Rizkiyanto, shows a child crouching by the edge of the ocean and 'lifting up' a wave, to reveal a cluster of assorted plastic waste, from polyethylene bags to water bottles. The artwork, designed to raise public awareness, left Ferrando angry - and fuelled with entrepreneurial ideas.\n\nB\n\nFerrando runs a Spanish-based design company, Closca, that produces an ingenious foldable bicycle helmet. But he has now also designed a stylish glass water bottle with a stretchy silicone strap and magnetic closure mechanism that means it can be attached to almost anything, from a bike to a bag to a pushchair handle. The product comes with an app that tells people where they can fill their bottles with water for free.\n\nC\n\nThe intention is to persuade people to stop buying water in plastic bottles, thus saving consumers money and reducing the plastic waste piling up in our oceans. 'Bottled water is now a $100 billion business, and 81 percent of the bottles are\n\nnot recycled. It's a complete waste - water is only 1.5 percent of the price of the bottle!' Ferrando cries. Indeed, environmentalists estimate that by 2050 there will be more plastic in our oceans than fish and that's mainly down to such bottles. We are trying to create a sense that being environmentally sophisticated is a status symbol,' he adds. 'We want people to clip their bottles onto what they are wearing, to show that they are recycling - and to look cool.'\n\nD\n\nFerrando's story is fascinating because ti seems like an indicator of something unexpected. Three decades ago, conspicuous consumption - the purchase of luxuries, such as handbags, shoes, cars, etc. on a lavish scale - heightened people's social status. Indeed, the closing decades of the 20th century were a time when ti seemed that anything could be turned into a commodity. Hence the fact that water became a consumer item, sold ni plastic bottles, instead of just emerging, for free, from a tap.\n\nE\n\nToday, though, conspicuous extravagance no longer seems desirable among consumers. Now, recycling is fashionable -as is cycling rather than driving. Plastic water bottles have become so common that they do not command status; instead, what many millennials - young people born ni the late 20th century - prefer to post on social media are 'real' (refillable) bottles or even the once widespread Thermos bottles. Some teenagers currently think that these stainless-steel vacuum-insulated water bottles that are coming back onto the market are ultra 'cool'; never mind the fact that they feel oddly out-of-date to anyone over the age of 40 or that teenagers in the 1970s would have avoided ever being seen with one.\n\nF\n\nIt is uncertain whether Closca will succeed in its goal. Although its foldable bike helmet is available in some outlets in New York, including the Museum of Modern Art, it can be very hard for any design entrepreneur to really take off in the\n\nglobal mass market, though not as hard as it might have been in the past. if an entrepreneur had wanted to fund a smart invention a few decades ago, he or she would have had to either raise a bank loan, borrow money from a family member or use a credit card. Things have moved on slightly since then.\n\nG\n\n\_Entrepreneurs are still using the last two options, but some are also tapping into\n\nthe ever-growing pot of money that is becoming available in the management world for 'corporate social responsibility' (CSR) investments. And then there are other options for those who wish to raise money straight away. Ferrando posted details about his water-bottle venture on a large, recognised platform for funding creative projects. He appealed for people to donate $30,000 of seed money - the money he needed to get his project going - and promised to give a bottle of anyone who provided more than $39 in 'donations'. If he received the funds, he stated that the company would produce bottles in grey and white; if $60,000 was raised, a multicoloured one would be made. Using this approach, none of the donors has a stake in his idea, nor does he have any debt. Instead, it is almost a pre-sale of the product, in a manner that tests demand in advance and creates a potential crowd of enthusiasts. This old-fashioned community funding with a digital twist is supporting a growing array of projects ranging from films to card games, videos, watches\n\nand so on. And, at last count, Closca had raised some $52,838 from 803 backers. Maybe, 20 years from now, it will be the plastic bottle that seems peculiarly old-fashioned.\n\n11\\.\n\nWhat does Ferrando say about his glass water bottle?\n\nA It matches his bicycle helmet.\n\nB It is cheaper than a plastic bottle.\n\nC He has designed it to suit all ages.\n\nD He wants people to be proud to show it.\n\n12\\.\n\nWhat does the writer find fascinating about Ferrando's story?\n\nA the youthfulness of his ideas\n\nB the old-fashioned nature of his products\_\n\nC the choice it is creating for consumers\n\nD the change it is revealing in people's attitudes\n\n13\\.\n\nWhat does the writer suggest about Closca's bike helmet?\n\nA It has both functional and artistic value.\n\nB Its main appeal is to older people.\n\nC It has had extraordinary success worldwide.\n\nD It is a more exciting invention than the glass bottle.\n\nTask 4\n\nChoose ONE WORD ONLY from the text above.\n\nFunding a smart invention\n\nThirty years ago, the methods used by creators to fund their projects involved getting\n\nmoney from the bank or from someone in the\_\n\n14 ........\n\nBanks today are still a useful source of finance, but investments may also be sought from 'corporate social responsibility' projects in order to get immediate funding, the method Ferrando took was to use a well-known 15….. to advertise his product and request financial support. People who gave a certain figure or over were offered a free gift. In addition, Ferrando advised his donors that his company would create bottles in two colours, followed by a 16….. bottle once they had received a more significant amount. In this way, Ferrando avoided debt and found out how many people might want his products before manufacturing them.\n\n14\\.\n\n15\\.\n\n16\\.\n\nUse of English\n\nTask 5\n\nRead the text below. Choose from (A-H) the one which best fits each space (17-22). There are two choices you do not need to use.\n\nTHE RUGBY GAME\n\nA new form of football originated in England during the 19th century, (17) the place where it was supposedly invented: Rugby School. In the early 1800s, football was played throughout England (and in many other countries too but there were no standard rules, and in (18) , the ball could be caught as well as kicked. However, running with the ball was largely outlawed. Legend has it that in 1823, a student at Rugby School (19) picked up the ball during a football match and ran with it towards the opposing goal line. This illegal action caused a permanent change in the rules of the game, or so the story goes, and from that day onwards, Rugby School played (20) which became known as Rugby Football. (The more familiar kind of football is officially known as Association Football to distinguish it from Rugby Football). To this day, there is an inscription at Rugby School celebrating William Webb Ellis and his actions, and although the historical truth of the events is (21) , the story endures. The plaque reads: 'This stone commemorates the exploit of\_ William Webb Ellis who with (22) as played in his time first took the ball in his arms and ran with it thus originating the distinctive feature of the Rugby game.'\n\nA most versions of the game\n\nB its own version of football\n\nC taking its name from\n\nD official known as\n\nE called William Webb Ellis\n\n\_\n\nG highly questionable\n\nF search for\n\nH a fine disregard for the rules of football\n\n17\\.\n\n18\\.\n\n19\\.\n\n20\\.\n\n21\\.\n\n22\\.\n\nTask 6\n\nRead and complete the text below. For each of the empty space (23-32) choose the correct answer (A, B, C or D).\_\n\nGARDENING IN THE CITY\n\nEven if you live in the heart of the city, there's no reason why you shouldn't (23)\\_ up gardening. We can't all afford a large garden, but we can all create a space where we can follow the seasons. Whether it's a window box, balcony or a tiny yard, anyone can have the pleasure of looking (24)\\_\_ plants. :\n\nA window box is a small box of plants that literally sits outside your window. Here, the choice of plants is what counts. You want a splash of colour all year (25)\\_ , so choose flowers that bloom at different times of the year. Daffodils, for example, are beautiful spring flowers and will soon have you looking forward to summer. Their bright colours will also attract butterflies, bringing a touch of life.\n\nif you've got a balcony, you've got a little more freedom. In this case, the key is to (26)\\_\n\nmaximum use of the space you've got available. Put taller plants against the wall of the house, with shorter plants and flowers along the (27)\\_\n\nof the balcony. You can also add a water feature; a small fountain creates interest and can have a cooling effect on a hot summer's day. If your neighbours' balcony is next to yours, why not use a fast- growing plant like wisteria to form a natural barrier, giving you more privacy?\n\nThose of you who are lucky enough to have a small yard can really go to town. Think about how you're going to use it. Do you want to be able to sit and enjoy the sun? Or do you want to be (28)\\_ to entertain friends and have a barbecue? Divide the yard into separate areas and plan each one carefully. Garden furniture is very important. Table that folds in half can give you a lot of flexibility, and chairs that fold away also allow you to change your garden to (29)\\_ your mood. As (30)\\_ as plants are (31)\\_ , choose varieties that don't mind a bit of shade, unless your yard gets a lot of sun. Yards often have walls that keep the sun out for long periods and you don't want your careful plans (32)\\_\n\nbecause a few of your plants start to die.\n\n23\\.\n\nA take\n\nB set\n\nC put\n\nD make\n\n24\\.\n\nA on\n\nB up\n\nC after\n\nD down\n\n25\\.\n\nA round\n\nB over\n\nC along\n\nD across\n\n26\\.\n\nA get\n\nB make\n\nC have\n\nD do\n\n27\\.\n\nA edge\n\nB boundary\_\n\nC rim\n\nD frame\n\n28\\.\n\nA capable\n\nB possible\_\n\nC able\n\nD probable\n\n29\\.\n\nA fit\n\nB suit\n\nC copy\n\nD go\n\n30\\.\n\nA much\n\nB long\n\nC few\n\nD far\n\n31\\.\n\nA concerned\n\nB referred\_\n\nC discovered\_\n\nD realized\n\n32\\.\n\nA spoiled\nB mixed\_ \_ \nC missed\_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \nD corrupted\n"
